# Gemini Multi Language Invoice Extractor

This Streamlit application leverages Google's Generative AI to analyze and extract information from invoice images. Users can upload an invoice image and ask questions about its contents, receiving detailed responses generated by the AI model.

## Functionality

1. **Upload Invoice Image**
   - Users can upload an invoice image in formats like jpg, png, or jpeg using the file uploader.

2. **Input Prompt**
   - Enter an initial prompt that sets the context for the AI model. This prompt guides the AI in generating relevant responses based on the uploaded invoice.

3. **Generate Responses**
   - Click the "Tell me about the Invoice" button to initiate processing.
   - The application processes the uploaded image and user prompt through Google's Generative AI model (`gemini-pro-vision`).
   - It generates and displays detailed responses that describe the content and details of the invoice based on the input prompt.
